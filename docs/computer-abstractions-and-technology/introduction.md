# Introduction

## Traditional Classes of Computing Applications and Their Characteristics

Typically divided into three classes:

1. **Personal Computers (PCs)**:

    - Typically emphasizes *good performance* to *single users* at *low cost*
      and typically executes *third-party software*.

2. **Servers**:

    - May carry out workloads of various sizes.
    - Places a higher emphasis on *dependability*.
    - High-end servers can come in the form of *supercomputers*.

3. **Embedded Computers**:

    - Spans wide range of applications.
    - Typically runs software integrated with the specific hardware.
    - Typically has constraints on *power* and *cost* when trying to maximize
      performance.
    - Often have low tolerance for failure, dependability often achieved via
      *redundancy*.
